# Port-Scanning

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based port scanner capable of identifying open ports on a target system. This tool helps in assessing network security by detecting potential vulnerabilities that malicious attackers could exploit. By utilizing socket programming and multithreading, the project ensures efficient and fast scanning of ports, providing valuable insights into system security. The ultimate goal is to enhance cybersecurity awareness and assist in securing networks against unauthorized access..

### Skills Learned

- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Python Programming – Enhanced proficiency in Python, including scripting and automation.
- Socket Programming – Gained hands-on experience in using Python’s socket module for network communication.
- Port Scanning Techniques – Learned different scanning methods (TCP Connect, SYN Scan, etc.).
- Network Security Fundamentals – Improved understanding of ports, protocols, and network vulnerabilities.
- IP Address and Port Analysis – Gained insights into how IP addresses and ports function in cybersecurity.
- Automation & Scripting – Improved the ability to automate network security tasks using Python.


### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
